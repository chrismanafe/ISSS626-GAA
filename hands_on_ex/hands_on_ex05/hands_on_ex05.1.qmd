# Overview

In this hands-on exercise, we will learn how to compute Global Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (GMSA) by using **spdep** package. By the end to this hands-on exercise, we will be able to:

-   import geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of **sf** package,

-   import csv file using appropriate function of **readr** package,

-   perform relational join using appropriate join function of **dplyr** package,

-   compute Global Spatial Autocorrelation (GSA) statistics by using appropriate functions of **spdep** package,

    -   plot Moran scatterplot,

    -   compute and plot spatial correlogram using appropriate function of **spdep** package.

-   provide statistically correct interpretation of GSA statistics.

# The Data

We will use following geospatial datasets in this exercise:

| Dataset      | Description                                                    | Format         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| *Hunan*      | Hunan county boundary layer geospatial data                    | ESRI shapefile |
| *Hunan_2012* | Contains selected Hunanâ€™s local development indicators in 2012 | CSV file       |

## Packages

We will use following packages in this exercise:

| Package                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

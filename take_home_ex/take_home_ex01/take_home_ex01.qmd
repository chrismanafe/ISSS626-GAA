# Overview

![Vehicles on a busy street in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region](images/cropped.png){fig-align="center"}

Road traffic accidents are a global concern, causing around 1.19 million deaths and leaving millions injured annually. These accidents disproportionately affect vulnerable road users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Low- and middle-income countries, which hold 60% of the world’s vehicles, account for 90% of fatalities. Beyond human suffering, road accidents also pose a significant economic burden, costing nations 3% of their GDP.

Thailand, with one of the highest road fatality rates in Southeast Asia, reports approximately 20,000 deaths annually, or 56 deaths each day. Between 2014 and 2021, the frequency of road accidents increased, particularly on national highways. Accident-prone areas, often referred to as "black spots," are primarily found on straight roads (66%), curves (13%), intersections, bridges, and slopes.

This analysis will focus on the [Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok_Metropolitan_Region), exploring the causes and patterns of road accidents using geospatial analytics. The study will consider both behavioral and environmental factors, and integrate temporal aspects, such as time of day, day of the week, and season, to provide a comprehensive understanding of road traffic accidents in the BMR.

## Data Wrangling

### Thailand Road Accident data

We will load Thailand Road Accident data using [read_csv()](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of **readr** package.

```{r}
accidents <- read_csv("data/aspatial/thai_road_accident_2019_2022.csv")
glimpse(accidents)
```

The dataset consists of 81,735 rows and 18 columns. Below is a detailed description of each column, as provided on Kaggle:

| **Column**                  | **Description**                                                                |

```{r}
colSums(is.na(accidents))
```

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
-   There are 359 rows with missing values in the `latitude` and `longitude` columns. We will drop rows with missing `latitude` and `longitude` values, as they represent a small portion(\<1%) of the dataset.
-   We will remove the `agency`, `province_th`, `route`, and `report_datetime` columns, because of following reasons:
    -   The `agency` column contains irrelevant information.
    -   The `province_th` column is redundant because the English equivalent is already provided in the `province_en` column.
    -   The `route` column, which lists road segment names in Thai, can be replaced with information provided by the `latitude` and `longitude` coordinates.
    -   The `report_datetime` column is redundant because `incident_datetime` column already captures the time of the accident.
-   Since the Bangkok Metropolitan Region consists of [six provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok_Metropolitan_Region) — Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Nakhon Pathom, Pathum Thani, Samut Prakan, and Samut Sakhon — we will filter the dataset using the *province_en* column to focus on these specific provinces.
-   We will use the *latitude* and *longitude* columns to convert the data into a spatial (`sf`) object by specifying the appropriate Coordinate Reference System (CRS). The EPSG code for the latitude-longitude projection (WGS 84) is [4326](https://epsg.io/4326), which uses degrees for measurement.
    -   For spatial analysis in Thailand, the preferred CRS is [EPSG:32647](https://epsg.io/32647), which uses meters as units and is based on the UTM Zone 47N projection.
-   We will extend the dataset by extracting the year, month, day of the week, and hour of each incident from the \*incident_datetime\* column to enhance temporal analysis.
:::

```{r}
bmr_provinces <- c("Bangkok", "Nonthaburi", "Nakhon Pathom", "Pathum Thani", "Samut Prakan", "Samut Sakhon")
accidents_bmr <- accidents %>% 
  filter(!is.na(longitude) & longitude != "",
         !is.na(latitude) & latitude != "") %>%
  select(-c(province_th, route, report_datetime, agency)) %>%
  filter(province_en %in% bmr_provinces) %>%
  mutate(
    Year = year(incident_datetime),
    Month_num = month(incident_datetime),
    Month_lab = month(incident_datetime, label = TRUE),
    Day_of_Week_num = wday(incident_datetime),
    Day_of_Week_lab = wday(incident_datetime, label = TRUE),
    Day_of_year = yday(incident_datetime),
    Hour = hour(incident_datetime)
  ) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 32647)

```

Using the extracted time data, we will classify each incident by season, identify whether it occurred during rush hours, determine if it took place on a weekday or weekend, and check if it coincided with Thailand's major festival, [Songkran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songkran_(Thailand)).

```{r}
accidents_bmr <- accidents_bmr %>%
  mutate(
    season = case_when(
      Month_num %in% c(3, 4, 5) ~ "summer",
      Month_num %in% c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10) ~ "rainy",
      Month_num %in% c(11, 12, 1, 2) ~ "winter"
    ),
    is_songkran = case_when(
      Year == 2019 & Month_num == 4 & day(incident_datetime) %in% c(12:16) ~ TRUE,  # Songkran in 2019 (12-16 April)
      Year != 2019 & Month_num == 4 & day(incident_datetime) %in% c(13:15) ~ TRUE,  # Songkran in other years (13-15 April)
      TRUE ~ FALSE
    ),
    rush_hour = case_when(
      wday(incident_datetime) %in% c(2:6) & hour(incident_datetime) %in% c(7:9) ~ TRUE,  # 7-9 AM on weekdays
      wday(incident_datetime) %in% c(2:6) & hour(incident_datetime) %in% c(16:19) ~ TRUE,  # 4-7 PM on weekdays
      TRUE ~ FALSE
    ),
    weekday_or_weekend = case_when(
      wday(incident_datetime) %in% c(2:6) ~ "weekday",  # Monday to Friday
      TRUE ~ "weekend"                      # Saturday and Sunday
    )
  )

```

We will simplify the `presumed_clause` column, as it currently contains 40 categories, making it too complex for effective analysis.

```{r}
# Define the categories
driver_behavior <- c("speeding", "running red lights/traffic signals", "tailgating", 
                     "illegal overtaking", "failure to yield/signal", "abrupt lane change", 
                     "driving in the wrong lane", "failure to signal enter/exit parking", 
                     "failure to yield right of way", "ignoring stop sign while leaving intersection", 
                     "reversing vehicle", "straddling lanes", "using mobile phone while driving", 
                     "using psychoactive substances", "loss of control", 
                     "driving under the influence of alcohol", "falling asleep", "medical condition")

road_environmental <- c("dangerous curve", "slippery road", "road in poor condition", 
                        "inadequate visibility", "obstruction in sight", "no traffic signs", 
                        "no road divider lines", "repair/construction on the road", 
                        "debris/obstruction on the road", "cutting in closely by people/vehicles/animals", 
                        "unfamiliarity with the route/unskilled driving", "sudden stop", 
                        "no presumed cause related to driver")

vehicle_related <- c("vehicle equipment failure", "worn-out/tire blowout", 
                     "disabled vehicle without proper signals/signs", "vehicle electrical system failure", 
                     "brake/anti-lock brake system failure", "overloaded vehicle", "insufficient light")

accidents_bmr$presumed_cause_category <- ifelse(accidents_bmr$presumed_cause %in% driver_behavior, "Driver Behavior",
                                               ifelse(accidents_bmr$presumed_cause %in% road_environmental, "Road/Environmental Conditions",
                                                      ifelse(accidents_bmr$presumed_cause %in% vehicle_related, "Vehicle-Related Violations", "Other")))
```

We will also simplify `vehicle_type` column.

```{r}
motorcycles_bicycles <- c("motorcycle", "motorized tricycle", "bicycle")
passenger_vehicles <- c("private/passenger car", "passenger pickup truck", "van", "large passenger vehicle")
light_trucks <- c("4-wheel pickup truck")
heavy_trucks <- c("6-wheel truck", "7-10-wheel truck", "large truck with trailer")
non_motorized <- c("pedestrian")
specialized_vehicles <- c("tractor/agricultural vehicle", "other")

accidents_bmr$vehicle_category <- ifelse(accidents_bmr$vehicle_type %in% motorcycles_bicycles, 
                                    "2-wheeled",
                             ifelse(accidents_bmr$vehicle_type %in% passenger_vehicles, 
                                    "Passenger Vehicles",
                             ifelse(accidents_bmr$vehicle_type %in% light_trucks, 
                                    "Light Trucks",
                             ifelse(accidents_bmr$vehicle_type %in% heavy_trucks, 
                                    "Heavy Trucks",
                             ifelse(accidents_bmr$vehicle_type %in% non_motorized, 
                                    "Pedestrian",
                             ifelse(accidents_bmr$vehicle_type %in% specialized_vehicles, 
                                    "SpecializedVehicles", 
                                    "Unknown"))))))
```

Before saving the dataset in RDS format, let's check for any duplicated records to ensure data integrity.

```{r}
any(duplicated(accidents_bmr))
```

No duplicated records were found, so we can proceed to save the dataset in RDS format.

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(accidents_bmr, "data/rds/road_accident_bmr.rds")
```

```{r}
accidents_bmr <- read_rds("data/rds/road_accident_bmr.rds")
```

Let's visualize the accident points in Bangkok Metropolitan Region.

```{r}
tmap_mode('plot')
tm_shape(accidents_bmr) +
  tm_dots(col='red',
          alpha=0.4, 
          size=0.04)
```

### Thailand Subnational Administration Boundary

The Thailand subnational administrative boundaries dataset is available at four levels: administrative level 0 (country), level 1 (province), level 2 (district), and level 3 (sub-district or tambon). For this analysis, we will use administrative level 1 (province) and filter the data to focus on the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR).

We will load the province-level boundaries using the `st_read()` function and filter the dataset to include only the provinces in the BMR. The boundaries will then be transformed into [EPSG:32647](https://epsg.io/32647), which uses meters as units and is based on the UTM Zone 47N projection.

```{r}
admin_boundary_bmr <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial/",
                           layer = "tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121") %>%
  filter(ADM1_EN %in% bmr_provinces) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 32647)
```

Let's verify the coordinate reference system of `admin_boundary_bmr`.

```{r}
st_crs(admin_boundary_bmr)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(admin_boundary_bmr, "data/rds/admin_boundary_bmr.rds")
```

```{r}
admin_boundary_bmr <- read_rds("data/rds/admin_boundary_bmr.rds")
```

Let's visualize the administrative boundaries map using **tmap**.

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
tmap_mode('plot')

tm_shape(admin_boundary_bmr) +
  tm_polygons(col = "ADM1_EN", palette = "Pastel1") +
  tm_text("ADM1_EN", size = 0.8) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) Administrative Boundaries",
            main.title.position = "center",
            frame = FALSE)
```

Let's plot the administrative boundaries along with the accident points from the earlier dataset to visualize their spatial distribution.

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
tmap_mode('plot')

tm_shape(admin_boundary_bmr) +
  tm_polygons(col = "ADM1_EN", palette = "Pastel1") +
  tm_shape(accidents_bmr) +
  tm_dots(col='red',
          alpha=0.4, 
          size=0.04) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "BMR Administrative Boundaries and Road Accidents",
            main.title.position = "center",
            frame = FALSE)
```

### Thailand Roads

Let us load Thailand Roads data using [*st_read()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_read.html) of **sf** package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
roads_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial",
                    layer = "hotosm_tha_roads_lines_shp")
```

We observed that `road_sf` lacks a CRS. To correct this, we'll first use `st_set_crs()` to assign the correct EPSG code, then apply `st_transform()` to project the data into the appropriate coordinate reference system. This dataset contains geometries in the form of `MULTILINESTRING`. We will apply `st_cast()` function to convert it into `LINESTRING`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
roads_sf <- st_set_crs(roads_sf, 4326)  %>%
  st_transform(crs = 32647) %>% 
  st_cast("LINESTRING")
```

Let us verify the CRS on \`roads_sf\`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
st_crs(roads_sf)
```

> `roads_sf` has the correct CRS, EPSG:32647.

Since the OpenStreetMap data includes a wide range of [road types](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway), we will filter the dataset to keep only the road classes that are relevant to our analysis. Based on the definition, we'll select the following road types:

-   motorway
-   trunk
-   primary
-   secondary
-   tertiary
-   motorway_link
-   trunk_link
-   primary_link
-   secondary_link
-   tertiary_link.

```{r}
#| eval: false
roads_sf <- roads_sf %>%
  filter(highway %in% c("motorway", "trunk", "primary", "secondary", "tertiary",
                        "motorway_link", "trunk_link", "primary_link", 
                        "secondary_link", "tertiary_link"))

```

```{r}
#| eval: false
unique(roads_sf$highway)
```

The `roads_sf` dataset contains all road information across Thailand. Since our analysis focuses on the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR), we will filter out roads located outside this area using [st_intersection()](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_binary_ops.html) function from **sf** package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
roads_bmr <- st_intersection(roads_sf, admin_boundary_bmr) %>%
  filter(st_geometry_type(.) == "LINESTRING")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
roads_bmr <- read_rds("data/rds/roads_bmr.rds")
```

Let us check for any invalid geometries from `roads_bmr`.

```{r}
invalid_geometries <- st_is_valid(roads_bmr, reason=TRUE)
```

```{r}
length(which(invalid_geometries != "Valid Geometry"))
```

There's no record with invalid geometries found in `roads_bmr`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(roads_bmr, "data/rds/roads_bmr.rds")
```

Now, let's visualize the road network along with accident locations within the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) for a clearer understanding of high-risk areas.

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(roads_bmr) +
  tm_lines(col = "gray", lwd = 0.7) +
  tm_shape(accidents_bmr) +
  tm_dots(col = "red", size = 0.1, alpha = 0.7) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Bangkok Metropolitan Region Road Network with Accident Locations",
            main.title.position = "center",
            frame = FALSE)
```

::: callout-note
**Initial Observations:**

-   Accidents are highly concentrated along major roads and highways, particularly in central urban areas.
-   Peripheral areas show fewer accidents, suggesting lower traffic volumes outside the city center.
-   Continuous accident clusters along key corridors indicate potential high-risk areas for traffic incidents.

### Converting sf data frame into spatstat's ppp format

As we plan to carry out spatial point pattern analysis with the `spatstat` package, we need to convert the spatial data from the `sf` format into the `ppp` format.

First, we create ppp objects from `accidents_bmr` data frame.

```{r}
accidents_bmr_ppp <- as.ppp(accidents_bmr)
summary(accidents_bmr_ppp)
```

Then we create `owin` objects from `admin_boundary_bmr` data frame.

```{r}
admin_boundary_bmr_owin <- as.owin(admin_boundary_bmr)
```

Now, we can create a ppp object by combining `accidents_bmr_ppp` and `admin_boundary_bmr_owin`.

```{r}
accidents_bmr_ppp = accidents_bmr_ppp[admin_boundary_bmr_owin]
plot(accidents_bmr_ppp)
```

Let us re-scale the unit of measurement from metre to kilometre before performing KDE.

```{r}
accidents_bmr_ppp.km <- rescale.ppp(accidents_bmr_ppp,
                                    1000, 
                                    "km")
```

:::

::: {.callout-note title="Observation"}
The following observations summarize key trends and patterns identified from the exploratory data analysis of road accidents in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR):

-   **Driver Behavior**: The majority of accidents in the BMR are caused by driver behavior.

-   **Vehicle Involvement**: Trucks, both light and heavy, are the most frequently involved vehicle category in accidents.

-   **Seasonal Trends**: While accidents are more common in the rainy season than in winter or summer, the difference is not significant.

-   **Weather Conditions**: A large proportion of accidents occur in clear weather, with only a small portion happening during rainy conditions.

-   **Day of the Week**: Accidents are slightly more frequent on Fridays and Saturdays compared to other days.

-   **Hour of Day**:

    -   **Two Accident Peaks**: There are two main peaks in accidents—one around 10 AM and another around 5 PM, likely corresponding to the morning and evening rush hours.

    -   **High Accident Frequency During Daytime**: Accidents remain consistently high between 10 AM and 2 PM, indicating sustained traffic activity during the business hours.

    -   **Low Accident Rates Late at Night**: Accident counts drop significantly between 2 AM and 6 AM, reflecting reduced traffic during late-night hours.

-   **Monthly Trends**: Accident frequency remains fairly consistent across months, with no major variations.

-   **Songkran**: A negligible number of accidents occur during the Songkran festival.

# Spatial Point Pattern Analysis

## First-order spatial point pattern analysis

### Computing kernel density estimation using automatic bandwidth selection method

We will compute the kernel density estimate (KDE) using different automatic bandwidth selection methods. Specifically, we will use `bw.diggle` and `bw.ppl` for the analysis to compare their results.

```{r}
kde_accidents_bmr_bw_diggle <- density(accidents_bmr_ppp.km,
                                       sigma=bw.diggle,
                                       edge=TRUE,
                                       kernel="gaussian") 

kde_accidents_bmr_bw_ppl <- density(accidents_bmr_ppp.km,
                                    sigma=bw.ppl, 
                                    edge=TRUE,
                                    kernel="gaussian")
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(kde_accidents_bmr_bw_diggle, main = "bw.diggle")
plot(kde_accidents_bmr_bw_ppl, main = "bw.ppl")
```

::: callout-note
#### Observation

-   Both **`bw.diggle`** and **`bw.ppl`** methods produce similar overall density patterns, with high-density areas highlighted in yellow and low-density areas in blue.

-   High-density zones appear to cluster along key road networks or points of interest in both estimates, indicating consistency between the two methods.
:::

### Computing kernel density estimation using adaptive bandwidth

Given the varying densities in our data and the consistent results from automatic bandwidth methods such as **`bw.diggle`** and **`bw.ppl`**, we will try to compute the density by using [adaptive.density()](https://rdrr.io/cran/spatstat.explore/man/adaptive.density.html) of **spatstat package**. Adaptive bandwidth methods are often better suited to capture both global trends and local variations, providing a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the spatial patterns without the risk of oversmoothing or undersmoothing.

```{r}
kde_accidents_adaptive_kernel <- adaptive.density(accidents_bmr_ppp.km, method="kernel")

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(kde_accidents_bmr_bw_diggle, main = "automatic - bw.diggle")
plot(kde_accidents_adaptive_kernel, main = "adaptive - kernel")
```

> Visually, these results are very similar because both **bw.diggle** and the **adaptive kernel method** adjust the bandwidth based on the local density of points in the dataset. Since both methods are adaptive in nature, they capture the same underlying spatial patterns and point densities, leading to similar visual outcomes. This consistency indicates that the spatial distribution of accidents is being accurately reflected by both approaches.

### Plotting KDE Maps

We will visualise **KDE (Kernel Density Estimate)** map with a color palette ranging from yellow to red to represent density. It includes BMR boundary polygons, a scale bar, and sets the map projection to the UTM Zone 47N (EPSG:32647).

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
#| code-fold: true
raster_kde_adaptive <- raster(kde_accidents_adaptive_kernel)
projection(raster_kde_adaptive) <- CRS("+init=EPSG:32647 +units=km")

tmap_mode('plot')

kde_diggle_tmap <- tm_basemap(server = "OpenStreetMap") +
  tm_shape(admin_boundary_bmr, ) +
    tm_polygons(alpha=0.1, id="ADM1_EN") +
  tm_shape(raster_kde_adaptive) +
    tm_raster("layer",
              n = 7,
              title = "KDE Adaptive",
              style = "pretty",
              alpha = 0.6,
              palette = "YlOrRd") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "KDE of Road Accidents in Bangkok Metropolitan Region",
            main.title.position = "center",
            frame = FALSE)

kde_diggle_tmap
```

::: callout-note
#### Observation

-   The map reveals that accidents are most concentrated in **Bangkok**, followed by **Samut Prakan** and **Pathum Thani** provinces.

-   The highest concentration of accidents occurs along **Motorway Route 7** (Bangkok–Ban Chang Motorway), with significant densities also observed on other major highways, including **Motorway Route 9** (Kanchanaphisek Road, also known as the Bangkok Outer Ring Road) and **Highway 338** (Borommaratchachonnani Road).

-   The concentration of accidents along these highways indicates that targeted safety interventions, such as traffic management, road safety improvements, or enhanced enforcement in these regions, may be effective in reducing accident rates.
:::

### Nearest neighbour analysis

In this section, we will perform the Clark-Evans test of aggregation for a spatial point pattern using the `clarkevans.test()` function from the **`spatstat`** package.

The test hypotheses are:

-   **H₀**: The spatial distribution of road accidents in BMR are randomly distributed.
-   **H₁**: The spatial distribution of road accidents in BMR are not randomly distributed.

We will use a 95% confidence interval.

```{r}
clarkevans.test(accidents_bmr_ppp,
                correction="none",
                clipregion="admin_boundary_bmr_owin",
                alternative=c("clustered"),
                nsim=99)
```

> **Interpretations:**
>
> -   The **Clark-Evans test** result (R = 0.19109, p-value \< 2.2e-16) suggests that road accidents in the dataset are **not randomly distributed**. Instead, they exhibit **significant clustering**, meaning accidents tend to occur in close proximity to each other rather than being spread out randomly across the region.
>
> -   This clustering is likely tied to underlying factors such as high traffic volumes or specific road types (e.g., intersections, highways).

## Network Constrained Spatial Point Pattern Analysis

In this section, we aim to analyze the spatial distribution of road accidents within the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) using **Network Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE)**. Unlike traditional spatial point pattern analysis, NKDE considers the road network as a constraint, ensuring that density estimates are calculated along the network itself, rather than across a continuous surface. This method is particularly well-suited for transportation-related incidents, where events (such as accidents) are tied to specific roads.

### Preparing the lixels objects

To begin, the road network will be prepared by segmenting the road lines into smaller units, known as **lixels** (linear pixels), using the [lixelize_lines()](https://jeremygelb.github.io/spNetwork/reference/lixelize_lines.html) function of **spNetwork** package. Choosing the appropriate **lixel length** and **minimum distance** is crucial. Shorter lixels offer finer spatial resolution but may increase computational cost, while longer lixels capture broader patterns.

We can determine the optimal lixel length by analyzing the distribution of road segment length.

```{r}
summary(st_length(roads_bmr))

quantile(st_length(roads_bmr), probs = seq(.1, .9, by = .1))
```

Surprisingly, road lengths in the BMR vary significantly, with half of the roads being up to 118 meters long. However, since we know previously that the accidents concentrated on highway, we'll set the length of lixel to 5,000 meters and minimum distance to 2,500 meters.

```{r}
lixels <- lixelize_lines(lines = roads_bmr,
                         lx_length = 5000,
                         mindist = 2500)
```

### Generating line centre points

Next, the [**`lines_center()`**](https://jeremygelb.github.io/spNetwork/reference/lines_center.html) function from the **spNetwork** package will be used to generate a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`(i.e., `samples`) by extracting the center points of each line segment. The following code chunk demonstrates this process.

```{r}
samples <- lines_center(lixels)
```

### Bandwidth selection

Before computing NKDE, it is essential to define the appropriate **bandwidth**, as described in the NKDE documentation. According to the documentation, bandwidth is the most critical parameter when performing kernel density estimation, as it controls the smoothing of the density estimation. In this analysis, we will use the [bw_cv_likelihood_calc()](https://jeremygelb.github.io/spNetwork/reference/bw_cv_likelihood_calc.html) function, which applies likelihood cross-validation through a leave-one-out approach. The idea is to find a bandwidth that produces the most accurate results by minimizing the difference when an event is removed from the dataset.

```{r}
#| eval: false
bws_selection_cv <- bw_cv_likelihood_calc(
  bws = seq(200,3000,100),
  lines = mtl_network, events = bike_accidents,
  w = rep(1,nrow(bike_accidents)),
  kernel_name = "quartic", method = "continuous",
  diggle_correction = FALSE, study_area = NULL,
  max_depth = 8,
  digits=2, tol=1, agg=50,
  sparse=TRUE, grid_shape=c(10,10),
  verbose=FALSE, check=TRUE)

write_rds(bws_selection_cv, "data/rds/bws_selection_cv.rds")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
bws_selection_cv <- read_rds("data/rds/bws_selection_cv.rds")
```

```{r}
cv_values <- data.frame(
  "bw" = bws_selection_cv$bw,
  "cv_likelihood_adpt_cont" = bws_selection_cv$cv_scores
)
cv_values
```

> -   Although the bandwidth range of **600-800** yields the lowest cross-validation likelihood scores, we have chosen a bandwidth of **1700** to produce smoother results.
>
> -   This larger bandwidth captures broader trends across the road network, offering a more generalized view of accident density.
>
> -   It is appropriate for our focus on overall patterns over BMR region rather than detailed, localized hotspots.

### Performing NKDE

We are now ready to compute the **Network Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE) using the bandwidth that we selected**, as demonstrated in the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
densities <- nkde(roads_bmr, 
                  events = accidents_bmr,
                  w = rep(1, nrow(accidents_bmr)),
                  samples = samples,
                  kernel_name = "quartic",
                  bw = 1700, 
                  div= "bw", 
                  method = "simple", 
                  digits = 1, 
                  tol = 1,
                  grid_shape = c(10,10), 
                  max_depth = 8,
                  agg = 50,
                  sparse = TRUE,
                  verbose = FALSE)
write_rds(densities, "data/rds/densities_1700.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
write_rds(densities, "data/rds/densities_1700.rds")
```

We can rescale the density values from number of accidents per meter to number of accidents per kilometer using the following code:

```{r}
densities = read_rds("data/rds/densities_1700.rds")
lixels$density <- densities*1000
lixels$density_lwd <- densities*1000*10
```

### Visualise using tmap package

Next, we will use the **tmap** package to visualize the Network Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE) results. To enhance the visibility of accident hotspots, we will represent network density through line widths. The line widths will be adjusted using the **`density_lwd`** column, which is calculated by multiplying the density by 10 to make the hotspots stand out more clearly on the map.

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
tmap_mode('plot')

tm_shape(admin_boundary_bmr) +
  tm_polygons(col = "white", border.col = "black", alpha = 0.5) +
tm_shape(lixels) +
  tm_lines(col = "density",
           palette = "YlOrRd",
           lwd = "density_lwd",
           title.col = "Accident Density",
           legend.lwd.show = F) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Network KDE of Road Accidents in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region",
            main.title.position = "center",
            frame = FALSE)

```

::: callout-note
-   Road segments with a higher density of accidents are highlighted in darker colors, while those with lower density are shown in lighter colors.
-   As expected, the concentration is mostly along highways, consistent with the earlier KDE map.
-   However, this interactive map allows us to identify specific road segments with particularly high accident concentrations in greater detail.
    -   For example, we can see the hot-spot on this part of the highway intersection on **Bangkok−Ban Chang Motorway**, located less than 11 km from **Suvarnabhumi Airport.**
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
Due to computational limitations, we are unable to run CSR test of road accidents on the network.

However, based on the current density results from NKDE, it suggests that the accident points are not forming regular patterns along the road network.

# Spatio-Temporal Network Constrained Point Pattern Analysis

In this section, we aim to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of road accidents using **Temporal Network Kernel Density Estimation (TNKDE)**. By incorporating both spatial and temporal dimensions, this analysis allows us to investigate how accident hotspots evolve over time across the road network.

## Spatio-Temporal bandwidth selection

We will calculate the **kernel density values over time** using several different bandwidths to explore how varying the bandwidth affects the temporal distribution of accidents. To find the optimal bandwidth, we will use [bw_tnkde_cv_likelihood_calc()](https://rdrr.io/cran/spNetwork/man/bw_tnkde_cv_likelihood_calc.html) function which employs cross-validation likelihood over lines length and time window.

```{r}
#| eval: false
cv_scores <- bw_tnkde_cv_likelihood_calc(
  bws_net = seq(100,3000,100),
  bws_time = seq(10,90,10),
  lines = roads_bmr,
  events = accidents_bmr,
  time_field = "Day_of_year",
  w = rep(1, nrow(accidents_bmr)),
  kernel_name = "quartic",
  method = "discontinuous",
  diggle_correction = FALSE,
  study_area = NULL,
  max_depth = 10,
  digits = 2,
  tol = 1,
  agg = 50,
  sparse=TRUE,
  grid_shape=c(10,10),
  sub_sample=1,
  verbose = FALSE,
  check = TRUE)

write_rds(cv_scores, 'data/rds/cv_scores.rds')
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
cv_scores <- read_rds('data/rds/cv_scores.rds')
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(cv_scores)
```

> We have obtained the cross-validation results for the bandwidth options in our spatio-temporal analysis.
>
> Using the **"leave one out cross-validation"** method, the optimal bandwidths are **3000 meters** for space and **90 days** for time.

## Compute Temporal Network Kernel Density Estimate (TNKDE)

Now, we will compute the **Temporal Network Kernel Density Estimation (TNKDE)** using the [tnkde()](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spNetwork/vignettes/TNKDE.html) function of spNetwork package with the selected bandwidth.

```{r}
#| eval: false

This code chunk is adapted from spNetwork [documentations example on tnkde()](https://rdrr.io/cran/spNetwork/man/tnkde.html). Below is a breakdown of key arguments used in this code:

-   **`bw_net = 3000, bw_time = 90`**: These parameters define the bandwidths for the network and time dimensions, set to `3000` meters and `90` days, respectively. These values were selected based on the results of the "leave one out cross-validation" discussed in the previous section.

-   **`trim_bw_net = 3100, trim_bw_time = 100`**: These parameters set the maximum values for the adaptive bandwidth in the network and time dimensions. In this case, we used simple rule-of-thumb values for `3100` meters and `100` days.

## Visualize TNKDE map

Upon completing the TNKDE density calculations, we will visualize the results as an animated GIF.

First, we will use the **`classInt`** package to create color breaks for the density values. The class intervals will be determined using the **k-means** algorithm to group the densities into meaningful ranges.

```{r}
all_densities <- c(tnkde_densities_adapt$k)
color_breaks <- classIntervals(all_densities, n = 10, style = "kmeans")
```

Next, we will generate individual maps for each sample time and compile them into `all_maps` using the [lapply()](https://rdrr.io/r/base/lapply.html) function. Each map will visualize the TNKDE densities for a specific time point, with dots representing the density values. The colors of the dots will correspond to the density values, using the color breaks and palette defined earlier.

We will create an **animated GIF** from the series of maps stored in the `all_maps` object using the [tmap_animation()](https://rdrr.io/cran/tmap/man/tmap_animation.html) function from the **tmap** package. After generating the GIF, we will display it using the [include_graphics()](https://rdrr.io/cran/knitr/man/include_graphics.html) function from the **knitr** package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
all_maps <- lapply(1:ncol(tnkde_densities_adapt$k), function(i){
  time <- sample_time[[i]]
  
  samples$density <- tnkde_densities_adapt$k[,i]
  map1 <- tm_shape(samples) + 
  tm_dots(col = "density", size = 0.01,
          breaks = color_breaks$brks, 
           palette = "YlOrRd",) + 
    tm_layout(legend.show=FALSE, main.title = as.character(time), main.title.size = 0.5)
  return(map1)
})

# creating a gif with all the maps
tmap_animation(all_maps, filename = "images/animated_map2.gif", 
               width = 1000, height = 1000, dpi = 300, delay = 50)
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/animated_map2.gif")
```

::: callout-note
From the animated GIF, we can observe that while there are some **minor temporal shifts** in accident density across certain areas of the BMR, the primary hotspots remain largely unchanged.

These consistent hotspots, as identified in the KDE analysis, suggest that certain locations consistently experience high accident rates over time.

Although there is some density movement in less concentrated areas, the major hotspots appear to be long-standing, emphasizing the need for focused road safety measures in these critical zones.

# Conclusions

## Key findings

1.  **Consistent Accident Hotspots**

    The **Network Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE)** and **Temporal NKDE (TNKDE)** analyses identified **consistent accident hotspots** across the BMR, particularly on major highways in **Bangkok** and **Samut Prakan** provinces. These areas show persistent high-density accident zones, suggesting that these locations face ongoing road safety challenges.

2.  Minimal Temporal Shifts

    The major hotspots remained **largely stable over time**, with only **minor temporal shifts** observed in less concentrated areas. This indicates that the high-risk areas are consistently prone to accidents throughout the year, likely due to factors like traffic congestion or complex road layouts.

3.  Accidents During Clear Weather

    Interestingly, most accidents occurred during **clear weather** conditions, despite the increased accident rates typically associated with the **rainy season**. This suggests that other factors, such as **driver behavior**, may have a greater influence on accident occurrence than weather alone.

4.  High-Risk Time Periods

    **Rush hours** (both morning and evening) were identified as periods with a higher distribution of accidents, reflecting the increased traffic volumes during commuting times.

## Limitation

One challenge I encountered was the difficulty in finding appropriate references on spatial point analysis. Some library documentation lacked clarity or contained outdated code, making it harder to fully understand the functions provided by certain packages. Additionally, limited computational resources restricted my ability to perform more extensive bandwidth tests and experiment with adaptive estimation techniques from spNetwork in the analysis.

## Future works

There are several ideas that can be explored for future work on this topic. These improvements could provide more depth to the analysis of road accidents in BMR.

1.  Focusing on High-Risk Provinces

    Given that accidents are most concentrated in **Bangkok**, **Samut Prakan**, and **Pathum Thani**, future analysis could prioritize these provinces. A more granular study might help identify specific local risk factors contributing to the high accident rates in these provinces.

2.  Exploring Different Temporal Aspects

    So far, my spatio-temporal point analysis has focused on day of the year. Future work could explore density patterns by hour or month to reveal more detailed trends and temporal shifts.

3.  Incorporating Additional Data

    Incorporating data like **traffic volumes** and **road maintenance locations** could add more depth to the analysis. Since the accidents are mainly concentrated on major highways in the BMR, these factors could help our analysis.
